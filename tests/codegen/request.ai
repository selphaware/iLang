Write a single, self-contained C99 program (one .c file) named "remineon.c" that uses SDL2 and SDL2_ttf to display text from a UTF-8 file "showme.txt" on a black background with a random neon color. Follow these rules exactly:

GENERAL:
- Only output the code for remineon.c (no prose, no code fences, no extra files).
- Strict C99, no compiler extensions, no C++.
- No global mutable state besides a single static 'running' flag for quit handling.
- Handle errors robustly; on any init/load failure, print to stderr and return non-zero.
- The window is 1280x720, resizable disabled, centered, vsync enabled if available.
- Close and free all SDL/TTF resources on exit.

INPUTS:
- Read lines from "showme.txt" (UTF-8). Each non-empty line is one message. Trim trailing CR/LF.
- If the file does not exist or contains no valid lines, show the single line: "NO TEXT FOUND".
- OPTIONAL argv[1]: font path (e.g., "./font.ttf"). If not provided or fails, try "./font.ttf". If still unavailable, fail with an error message.

RENDERING & ANIMATION:
- Background must be pure black every frame (0,0,0).
- Font size: choose a size so that most lines fit on screen; dynamically scale down if needed per line to keep text fully on screen with some margin.
- "Cool-looking" neon effect:
  - Pick a random neon base color (high saturation and high value). Generate via HSV with S>=0.9, V=1.0; random hue on each cycle.
  - Render a multi-pass glow: first draw 3–5 blurred/outlined passes around the text (use TTF_SetFontOutline for an outline > 0 and multiple faded passes in the base color at decreasing alpha), then the main crisp glyphs on top in the base color at full alpha.
- Flashing:
  - Continuously pulse the text alpha using a sine wave: alpha = 160 + 95*sin(2*pi*F*t), where F = 2.0 Hz, t in seconds. Clamp to [0,255].
- Minute cycle:
  - The program iterates through the file’s lines, showing one line for exactly 60 seconds.
  - At the START of each 60-second interval:
    - Instantly choose a new random neon base color (as defined above).
    - Perform a quick spin animation of the text around its CENTER: rotate from 0° → +360° over 0.6 seconds at a smooth constant angular speed, then return to 0° (no overshoot). During the spin, keep flashing and glow active. Rotation must use SDL_RenderCopyEx with the destination rect centered so rotation is around the text center.
  - After 60 seconds elapse, advance to the next line (wrap around to the first line).

LAYOUT:
- Compute the text size with TTF_SizeUTF8. If it would exceed the window width or height, reduce the effective font size iteratively until it fits with 5% margin on all sides. Cache/reuse the scaled TTF_Font for that line and size.
- Render the text centered both horizontally and vertically each frame.
- High-DPI aware: query drawable size (SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize or SDL_GetRendererOutputSize) and base scaling on the actual render target size.

TIMING:
- Use SDL_GetTicks() (ms) for animation timing.
- Frame loop should target ~60 FPS via SDL_Delay if needed.
- The spin starts exactly when a new line/minute begins and lasts 600 ms. Outside that window, rotation angle must be exactly 0°.

COLOR & RANDOM:
- Seed the RNG with time(NULL) at startup.
- Implement HSV→RGB conversion to produce the neon base color. Keep the glow passes using the same hue with lower alpha.

FILE RELOAD:
- Check the modification time of "showme.txt" once every 10 seconds; if it changed, reload and reset the list of lines (preserve current index if still valid; otherwise clamp). If after reload there are zero lines, fall back to "NO TEXT FOUND".

EVENTS:
- Handle SDL_QUIT and ESC to exit cleanly.
- Handle window minimize/restore without crashing.
- Ignore mouse/other events.

API CHOICES:
- Use SDL2 (renderer API) and SDL2_ttf. Do not use OpenGL, SDL_image, or other libraries.
- Create textures from rendered glyph surfaces (TTF_RenderUTF8_Blended).
- For glow: use TTF_SetFontOutline with outline sizes (e.g., 6, 3, 1) and render those passes with decreasing alpha before the main pass.

BUILD:
- Code must include only the necessary #includes and compile cleanly with -Wall -Wextra.
- Provide comments (top-of-file and above major functions) but keep them concise.
- Do not embed any fonts. The font path is argv[1] or "./font.ttf".
- The code should compile with:
  * Linux:  gcc -std=c99 -O2 -Wall -Wextra remineon.c -o remineon `sdl2-config --cflags --libs` -lSDL2_ttf
  * MSYS2/MinGW: gcc -std=c99 -O2 -Wall -Wextra remineon.c -o remineon.exe -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf
- No other dependencies.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (do, but do not explain in prose):
- Represent a “LineSpec” with text string, chosen (and possibly scaled) font size, and a prepared set of textures (outline passes + main). Rebuild these when font size changes or when the color changes at the minute boundary.
- For flashing, modulate the texture alpha each frame (SDL_SetTextureAlphaMod) on all passes.
- For spinning, compute angle based on (ticks_since_minute / 600ms) * 360.0 for the first 600 ms, else 0. Use SDL_RenderCopyEx centered on the text rect center.
- Free all intermediate SDL_Surfaces immediately after creating SDL_Textures. On color change, rebuild the outline/main textures for the new base color.
