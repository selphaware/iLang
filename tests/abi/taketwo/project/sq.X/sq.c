I don’t have the contents of sq.h. Please provide the header so I can implement sq.c correctly.

If you prefer, you can paste just the function prototypes and related types/macros. Also note any expected error codes and ownership rules for any allocated memory.

Per your requirements, I’ll:
- Implement all declared functions with no globals, no I/O, C99 only.
- Validate pointers for any status-returning function with out-parameters and return nonzero on error.
- Return 0x00010000 from any ABI version function.
